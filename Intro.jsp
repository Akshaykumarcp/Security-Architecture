<h1><a name="service"></a>Service Models</h1>
    <p>
Cloud computing has been categorized into three models depending on the services provided by the cloud. Following is the brief description of each service model.</p>
<p><b>Software as a Service (SaaS):-</b>
The consumer is provided with the capability to use provider’s application running on a cloud infrastructure. The consumer does not have to manage cloud infrastructure like servers, operating system, storage and network. The services are accessed typically with a web browser.</p>
<p><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS):-</b>
The consumer is provided with the capability to create applications on their own or through the tools provided by the provider on cloud infrastructure. The consumer has the control over their deployed applications but have not to manage server, storage, network or operating system.</p>
<p><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):-</b>
The consumer is provided with the capability to processing, storage, networks and any software which they want to run and the operating system which they choose on the cloud infrastructure. The consumer does not control the cloud infrastructure but networking components like host firewall, storage, operating systems and deployed applications are controlled by the consumer.
<p>
<h1><a name="deploy"></a>Deployment Models</h1>
<p><b>Hybrid cloud:-</b>
This is the combination of different types of clouds (public, community or private clouds)  The hybrid cloud has clear limitations for data/application access but as they are part of a single standardized or proprietary technology, which allows the data and application to be moved if required from one cloud to another.</p>
<p><b>Public cloud:-</b>
The cloud is available to the public on commercial basis by a cloud service provider. The public cloud has a large variety of organizational and general public clients making it easier to adapt but more vulnerable to security risks.</p>
<p><b>Private cloud</b>
The cloud is maintained and operated for a specific organization. Private cloud can be in house or with a third party on the premises. Clients within the security premises can access the cloud services whereas the unauthorized clients are blocked.
